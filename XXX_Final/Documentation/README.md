## 🎯 **Quick Reference:**

### **SAST (Static Analysis):**
- **Purpose**: Find vulnerabilities in your code
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ with semantic understanding
- **Features**: 50+ advanced features
- **Remediation**: Automatic fix suggestions

### **SCA (Dependency Analysis):**
- **Purpose**: Find vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Approaches**: Traditional (rule-based) + ML-enhanced
- **Coverage**: Known CVE + predicted vulnerabilities
- **Priority**: Intelligent scoring and ranking

### **GitLab Integration:**
- **Purpose**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Coverage**: SAST + SCA combined
- **Reports**: GitLab Security Dashboard
- **Blocking**: Prevents deployment of vulnerable code
